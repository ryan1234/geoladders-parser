I was hanging with the virtual partner for the first quarter of the ride, but he kept getting stronger while I kept getting weaker.  Haha.  The terrain and grade of the middle of the course was hard on me.  Would have been a challenge even if I was fresh.  Second loop marked the longest distance for one day on the bike at 80 something.

California	12/04/2008	Thu	Maple Springs - Modjeska Peak	17 miles	3,182 ft	58	points	10	bonus	6:38/mi	9mph	1:55:45 1:55:45	Night ride with Doug and Matt.  Not sure how they entered in a slower ride time than me when they were faster all night.  *shrug*  Cold and windy. 	1460

California	11/29/2008	Sat	Old Camp - Luge	16 miles	2,784 ft	57	points	3	bonus	Post holiday ride with Corby and James.  Felt great on the SS.  Rigid down the luge wasn't quite as bad as I thought it would be. 
California	11/24/2008	Mon	Maple Springs - Motorway	17 miles	4,254 ft	68	points	10	bonus	7:50/mi	7.6mph	2:11:51 2:11:51	Night ride with Matt and Andrew.  Felt like we were going really slow, but I had a new PB by 12 minutes.  Super, super slow going down the Motorway.  Combination of not having done it in a while, having a bad light and being on a trail that is loose and rutted. 	1612
California	11/22/2008	Sat	Whiting Ranch - Live Oak	6 miles	690 ft	20	points	6:26/mi	9.3mph	0:37:28 0:37:28	Victory lap with Matt.  Not very fast.  Both hamstrings cramped halfway up Mustard.  Had to stop for a minute, but finished the climb ok. 	484
California	11/22/2008	Sat	Whiting,Old Camp,Luge,Oneill,Vista,Bonzai	28 miles	4,473 ft	88	points	6:40/mi	9mph	3:08:20 4:04:38	Good ride with the gang.  Pushed hard and suffered as a result.  Like the new Kenda on the front. 	2391

Felt strong and fast to Old Camp, but overall time wasn't that great.  Rode like an old lady down the luge.  My backup light mounted on the helmet freaking sucks.  Good to have these trails back. 	1282
California	11/08/2008	Sat	Horsethief - San Juan - Caspers - Coto	42 miles	6,194 ft	127	points	5	bonus	7:22/mi	8.1mph	5:06:42 5:06:42	Started the ride with Matt, Mark, Troy and Brian.  Ran into Dale at the top of Horsethief.  Matt and I split off for a mini super loop.  30 minutes faster than the last time I did this loop.  Excited about that ... 	3413

California	10/25/2008	Sat	Holy Jim - Trabuco Trail	26 miles	4,240 ft	96	points	So much to say.  Only one dab from start of Trabuco up to Horsethief.  Actually not a dab ... an OTB climbing which broke my garmin off my stem.  Rest of the ride I felt great.  Then crashed REALLY hard on Trabuco Creek Road of all places.  Flew to Chicago right after the ride and was limping big time after sitting on plane for over 3 hours.  Good times.  Did this loop backwards for the first time. 
California	10/18/2008	Sat	San Juan Trail (up and down)	23 miles	3,690 ft	99	points	Needed this ride to clear my head.  Thanks for the company Troy, Brian and Matt.  Did Viejo Tie for extra credit. (3:21 ride time)  Saw Bikesurfski near Blue Jay.

California	10/12/2008	Sun	Big Bear Shoot Out #2 - Fall Classic 2008	19 miles	2,371 ft	53	points	10	bonus	5:37/mi	10.7mph	1:46:11 1:47:47	Congrats to Jason for his first first place finish.  Ended up fourth for the year in my class after two sub-par races to end the season.  Glad the series is over and happy to have finished what I started. 	1434

Good night ride with Matt and Jason.  Simple out and back.  Hooray for getting a call from work after the ride and having to go into the office.  =/ 
California	09/28/2008	Sun	08/09 Santa Barbara - Elings Park (CAT II 3 laps)	16 miles	2,507 ft	50	points	10	bonus	6:57/mi	8.6mph	1:52:55 1:53:18	Started out much better than last time in SB.  Then I crashed and went straight to last place.  All I wanted was to not DNF and as a result my time was ... humiliating.  Congrats to Jason who just gets faster and faster. 	1326
California	09/23/2008	Tue	Blackstar to Doppler ball	18 miles	2,357 ft	52	points	10	bonus	5:27/mi	11mph	1:39:39 2:15:57	Felt really bad on this ride.  Not sure why, but my legs were uber dead.  Fun doing some new singletrack coming down Blackstar.  Singletrack and Blackstar in the same sentence!  Rode with Jason, Matt and Andrew.  The House continues to train ... 	1186
California	09/21/2008	Sun	Ladera/Tijeras Creek QD Loop	13 miles	1,373 ft	34	points	5	bonus	8:40/mi	6.9mph	1:51:32 2:18:32	Nice afternoon ride with Corby and Jeff.  I've been wanting to explore Gilleran and the other side of Tijeras, so we finally did it.  Don't know that I have any reason to go back over there.  Haha.  Need to figure out better connectors.  Saw Doug riding as we were wrapping up. 	941
California	09/20/2008	Sat	Coal Canyon - Blackstar	35 miles	5,971 ft	120	points	6:31/mi	9.2mph	3:48:48 4:14:34	Ouch.  Rode with Matt, Scott and Mark.  Mark is the man to beat these days.  Suffered coming up Coal.  Need to train on this trail more. 	2708
California	09/13/2008	Sat	Trabuco Canyon - Bell Ridge	20 miles	4,510 ft	108	points	5	bonus	10:44/mi	5.6mph	3:39:09 3:39:09	Good group ride with Troy, Brian 2x, Matt, Jason, Mark and Jake.  We did a variation at the end which was new to me. 	2325

California	09/09/2008	Tue	Blackstar Canyon - Sierra Peak	22 miles	3,157 ft	65	points	15	bonus	5:28/mi	11mph	1:57:53 2:10:00	Night ride with Jason, Andrew, Matt and Doug.  54 to Beeks.  Tried to beat my PB for Sierra and only tied it. 	1592

This ride didn't take as long as I thought it would.  Tried to explore some of sewerworks.  There is really nothing out there that is too interesting.  Ha.  Scared a guy on a Yeti pretty good coming back on Ladera. 	1055
California	09/01/2008	Mon	Old San Juan Trail	18 miles	3,260 ft	82	points	20	bonus	Fun group ride.  One flat and one stupid crash.  Nice to put some faces to names.  Added Viejo Tie.

Somewhere in Whiting I started to crack and it made the rest of the ride kind of miserable.  The bachelor party the day before took more out of me than I thought.  Been a while since I've suffered this bad on a ride.  Bleh.  Solo. 	2417
California	08/21/2008	Thu	QD - Missed Doug/Riley Explore	19 miles	2,108 ft	52	points	5	bonus	6:15/mi	9.6mph	1:59:35 2:00:18	Just barely missed Doug at the waterfall this morning.  Sorry Doug.  Tried to catch you on West Ridge but I was too slow.  Explored some new trails on West Ridge and in Riley.  Think I actually did every possible trail in Riley.  Saw three deer in Riley which was cool.  Solo. 	1489
California	08/19/2008	Tue	QD - Ladera/WW/Lookouts/Tijeras	20 miles	2,466 ft	57	points	5	bonus	5:59/mi	10mph	1:59:53 1:59:53	Solo before work ride.  Finally found 	Whaley	 hill near the third lookout.  Ouch.  Cleared it, but it definitely hurt a little. 	1620
California	08/16/2008	Sat	Bommer: Wilderness Access Day	22 miles	3,762 ft	71	points	8:29/mi	7.1mph	3:08:15 4:12:57	Still frustrated about not making the hill climbing challenge in about 10 attempts.  Congrats to Troy who was the only one to make it (made it twice even).  Good times on some new trails with the usual gang. 	1997
California	08/16/2008	Sat	Waterworks/Tijeras Creek Loop	11 miles	865 ft	27	points	8:33/mi	7mph	1:35:19 1:51:06	Took Brandon on his first ever mountain bike ride.  Maybe a bit too much for a first ride, but he managed to survive.  Ha.  Corby and Jeff also came along ... 	727
California	08/13/2008	Wed	QD - Chiquita / Caspers	29 miles	3,133 ft	77	points	5	bonus	5:42/mi	10.5mph	2:44:35 2:44:35	Solo before work.  Had a little extra time this morning waiting for an electrician so I took advantage.  Think I went up Cougar Pass (that's what I was trying to do).  If so, it was pretty loose, but I made it without stepping off.

Saw a few other riders out.  Great morning to ride. 	2210
California	08/12/2008	Tue	QD - Chiquita/Bell View Exploration	15 miles	1,908 ft	43	points	5:41/mi	10.5mph	1:26:47 1:28:38	Solo ride before work.  By the time I got to Bell View I didn't have too much time to explore.  I either need to start earlier or ride faster to get some proper exploration done.  Scared a pretty hot train runner girl on Chiquita on the way back. 	1200
California	08/09/2008	Sat	QD - Ladera Exploration	20 miles	2,127 ft	54	points	5:42/mi	10.5mph	1:56:33 1:56:33	Solo ride.  Wanted to see if I could find the Ladera Lookout trail and I'm pretty sure I found it.  Some decent climbing.  Someone said the lookout climbs were harder than the 3B's ... not so sure about that. 
California	08/07/2008	Thu	Coto - Valley Loop Trail	15 miles	1,824 ft	40	points	Solo.  First before work ride I've done in a while.  Hard to get the motor running in the morning. 
California	08/05/2008	Tue	Chiquita Strks x4/Ladera/Waterworks/Tijeras	20 miles	2,305 ft	54	points	5	bonus	Solo.  Been a while since I've done this route.  Overgrown in a few places, but still a pretty decent ride.  Easy pace was a nice change. 
California	08/02/2008	Sat	Trabuco Creek > Holy Jim > Santiago Peak > Upper Holy Jim	25 miles	5,090 ft	88	points	Good Saturday ride with the usual suspects.  Happy to start doing the longer tougher rides again.  Still sore from a small crash on Holy Jim while I was trying to keep pace with Frank the Tank. 
California	07/31/2008	Thu	Coto - Valley Loop Trail	15 miles	1,824 ft	40	points	5	bonus	5:06/mi	11.8mph	1:16:00 1:18:00	Solo ride.  Saw a few riders in Chiquita.  New personal best on this route by 5 minutes.  I tied Troy's best ... now I need to beat it.  I'm coming for you Troy! 
California	07/29/2008	Tue	Coto - Valley Loop Trail	15 miles	1,824 ft	40	points	Took the day off to rest a little and run some errands for the new home.  I now live half a mile off this loop, so this will probably be the new standard ride.  Tried to get some stress out ... not sure how well it worked. 
California	07/29/2008	Tue	Coto - Caspers West Ridge	15 miles	1,297 ft	31	points	5	bonus	Second route for the day.  Didn't see any other riders out.  Was a pretty great day to be out riding minus a little heat.  Feels good to be riding again after some time off. 
California	07/25/2008	Fri	Whiting Ranch - Live Oak	6 miles	690 ft	20	points	Lap 2 of 2.  Wanted to race Rim Nordic on Sunday but was too tired from the move.  =(  Not feeling strong on the bike right now with all the inactivity. 
California	07/25/2008	Fri	Whiting Ranch - Live Oak	6 miles	690 ft	20	points	Lap 1 of 2 from Friday.  Happy to have finished moving from Foothill Ranch to Trabuco Canyon.  Won't be riding Whiting as my 	out the door	 ride anymore.  Whew! 
California	07/19/2008	Sat	SC Pier to Singletracks Big Loop	21 miles	3,220 ft	65	points	5	bonus	Tough ride for me.  There are some challenging trails out in San Clemente.  Felt hard to get a good rhythm going but it's always nice exploring new trails. 
California	07/17/2008	Thu	Whiting Ranch - Live Oak	6 miles	690 ft	20	points	Lap 2 of 3.  Jason caught me on Borrego and I couldn't seem to keep up on Mustard after he got in front.  Hurt trying to catch up. 
California	07/17/2008	Thu	Whiting Ranch - Live Oak	6 miles	690 ft	20	points	Lap 1 of 3. 
California	07/17/2008	Thu	Whiting Ranch - Live Oak	6 miles	690 ft	20	points	Lap 3 of 3 from Thursday.

California	07/15/2008	Tue	Whiting Ranch - Live Oak	6 miles	690 ft	20	points	Lap 2 of 3.  Whiting feels like an old quarterback that has come out of retirement.  You're happy he is back, but he lacks his former glory.  Maybe the Vikings want Whiting? 
California	07/15/2008	Tue	Whiting Ranch:Cactus-Sage Scrub	7 miles	880 ft	24	points	Lap 1 of 3.  I was encouraged by all the posts since Saturday saying the sand was better, but I found it to be just as bad.  Whiting feels like a free for all right now with people riding up and down every trail in the park.  Be careful around corners and on descents. 
California	07/12/2008	Sat	Canada Vista/Bell View/Hal's/Whiting/Oakley/O'Neill	34 miles	4,081 ft	96	points	5	bonus	Nice ride with friends.  	What about Whiting's birthday?	  There is always one in every crowd.  Disappointed by the state of Whiting and pleasantly surprised by Bonzai. 
California	07/10/2008	Thu	Santiago Oaks: Chutes	6 miles	883 ft	24	points	3	bonus	With Matt and Andrew ... SS was tougher than I thought it would be.  Had a hard time keeping traction on the B's - only cleared the third B.  Going down Chutes with a rigid bike is interesting.  Cleared it all, but got a mild headache in the process. 
California	07/10/2008	Thu	Peters Canyon (dual loop)	6 miles	751 ft	21	points	18	bonus	Traded bikes around after Big Red.  Pretty disappointed I couldn't clear Big Red on the SS.  I'm now 1 for 2 in attempts.  Felt really tired and weak. 
California	07/05/2008	Sat	Mammoth: Off the Top/Beach Cruiser/Downtown/Flow/Shotgun	12 miles	236 ft	24	points	6:19/mi	9.5mph	1:17:20 1:17:20	Ride 6.

California	07/04/2008	Fri	Mammoth: Juniper/PR/UT/BC/Minaret/BC/DT/Shotgun	23 miles	2,959 ft	67	points	5	bonus	Legs hurt.  Ryan tired.  Thanks Andrew, Jason, Matt. 
California	07/03/2008	Thu	Mammoth: Juniper Lakes - Paper Route	12 miles	2,181 ft	39	points	10	bonus	Rode with Jason and Matt.  A good start. 
California	06/28/2008	Sat	Best of Aliso CV/Laguna Coast/El Moro Volume #1	23 miles	4,254 ft	76	points	Good times with Jason, Matt, Andrew and two guys we picked up named Todd and Jeff.

Only had to dab on T	A once at the boulder section.  Couldn't quite make the left hand turn.  Otherwise first time riding 100% of it. 
California	06/26/2008	Thu	Rushak: Santiago Oaks - Anaheim Hills - Irvine Regional	14 miles	2,149 ft	42	points	Rode with Matt, Jason and my new big ring brother, Andrew.  The poop turned a good ride into a frustrating ride even though I didn't get the worst of it. 
California	06/24/2008	Tue	Santiago Oaks: Chutes	6 miles	883 ft	24	points	Lap 1 of 2 with Matt and Andrew.  Cool to see Mike out riding.  Haven't seen him in a while. 
California	06/24/2008	Tue	Santiago Oaks: Chutes	6 miles	883 ft	24	points	Lap 2 of 2. 
California	06/21/2008	Sat	Chiquita-Palomia-Ladera-Waterworks-Arroyo Trabuco-Oniell	29 miles	2,811 ft	76	points	Good to ride with a bunch of guys I hadn't seen for a while.  Too many to name.  Not a ton of climbing for this route, but better than nothing, right?  First time down Eagle in O'neill.  Super hot by the time we finished.  Doug kept me and Troy company when I flatted on Arroyo Trabuco. 
California	06/19/2008	Thu	QD - Day in Oneil	15 miles	2,420 ft	46	points	6:35/mi	9.1mph	1:38:41 1:43:19	Solo.  Garmin shut itself off at least 5 times.  I need to stop being lazy and send it back.  First time trying to climb Vista.  Dabbed twice at the bottom and missed one of the switchbacks at the top, but otherwise did ok.  Confident I can clear the entire thing soon.  Only so much to ride in such a small area. 	865
California	06/17/2008	Tue	Rushak: Oneill-Live Oak-Vista-Coyote-Live Oak	11 miles	1,665 ft	34	points	10	bonus	Forgot to bring Garmin so this is probably the closest to what I actually rode.  Nice to get a change of scenery.  Happy to be riding after a little more than a week off. 
California	06/08/2008	Sun	08/09 Santa Barbara - Elings Park (CAT II 3 laps)	16 miles	2,507 ft	50	points	15	bonus	6:10/mi	9.7mph	1:40:02 1:40:02	Another fourth place finish.  =(  Congrats to Jason for finishing third in a tough class. 
California	06/08/2008	Sun	Santa Barbara - - Ellings Park	9 miles	1,316 ft	26	points	Garmin shut off again.  Obviously I need to send it in.  This isn't the same as the 2008 course, but close enough.  Pre-ride with Doug before the race. 
California	06/05/2008	Thu	Peters Canyon (dual loop)	6 miles	751 ft	21	points	5	bonus	... 
California	06/05/2008	Thu	Chutes/Fenceline/Irvine	11 miles	1,225 ft	28	points	Garmin shut off again.  *sigh*  Time to send it back.  Fun times with Matt and Andrew.  Lots of interesting singletrack near the park.

Started with the SS but had to swap bikes a little ways after the pavement because it was too much.  Rode the SS back down and the rigid fork made the trip down _miserable_.  Came very, very close to being hit by a speeding truck.  Freaking kids.  Too bad Koke had to turn around with the crank issue.  At least it was 	mission accomplished	 with the stash for Saturday.

This was supposed to be two laps, but when I checked my bike I noticed the rear shock was dead.  No way to lock it out.  So I changed my pedals and rode my hard tail.

First time down Upper Holy Jim and I only rode down about 1/4 of it.  Hopefully the more I do it, the more I'll ride.  The singletrack before the peak is _weak_.

I was feeling good before the ride, but realized I was in trouble once I started.  My legs were already hurting and this ride just buried me.  Tons and tons of people on the trail too.  The bell on the bike really comes in handy.

He scared the crap out of me by doing the jump at the top of the third B.  Some kids were doing it and he felt he had to do it too to be a man or something.  Thought for sure we were going to have to cut the ride short with a trip to the ER.  Almost ate it a few times, but stayed on the bike.

Forgot to turn GPS back on at start of Trabuco after a break.  Not happy about that.

Corby, Jeff and I tried to do the ride bigguy posted that combines Tijeras Creek and West Ridge.  He forgot to leave any kind of direction, so we got lost at Arroyo Trabuco and tried to ride over to what we thought was West Ridge.  We were wrong.  We ended up bushwhacking through faint to non-existant single track on the ridge before finally hitting a road we could ride back to Dove Canyon.  Saw four deer, crossed two barbed wire fences and rode across at least four streams.
